              A water softener is an ion exchange system that works by removing calcium & magnesium ions that make up hard water. When water flows through a Softener, the system exchanges these hard water minerals, and the softened water then leaves the water softening system.

              Norwa Africa can help you achieve superior filtration no matter your location! Water is classified as “hard water” when high amounts of calcium and magnesium are present. This causes minerals and other particles to buildup and form clogs in your pipes. To create soft water, a water softening system with sodium regeneration is installed. Complete Water Solutions offers a variety of water softening options, creating the perfect water service to meet your needs. Learn when you should have your water softener serviced here. Soft water is not only better for your pipes, but it also helps reduce scale on boilers, cooling towers, and other processes.        </p>

          <p class="about__body">
            A water softener is made up of three components: a control valve, a mineral tank, and a brine tank. These three work in conjunction to remove the minerals from hard water, monitor the flow of water, and periodically clean the system through a regeneration process.
            <span class="about__heading content__heading" style="color: green;">1. The mineral tank</span>
              <span class="about__p content__p var">
                The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances.
              </span> 
            </span>
            <span class="about__heading content__heading" style="color: green;">2. The control valve</span>
              <span class="about__p content__p var">
                The control valve measures the amount of water passing through the mineral tank and into your house. The valve houses a meter that tracks the volume of water entering the mineral tank. As hard water flows through the mineral tank, the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads exchange their sodium ions for hardness ions. Over time, this depletes the capacity of the resin to continue to effectively soften water. Before the beads become too burdened with mineral content to continue removing calcium and magnesium ions, the control valve automatically initiates a regeneration cycle. This maximum capacity is pre-programmed into the control valve’s onboard computer and is based on a range of factors, like the size of your house, the number of occupants, and the hardness of your water. Control valves are demand-initiated controllers, which allow water softening units to be extremely efficient.

            </span>
            <span class="about__heading content__heading" style="color: green;">3. The brine tank</span>
              <span class="about__p content__p var">
                The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads’ positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.

                <span class="about__p content__p var">Norwa Africa water softeners are designed for industrial applications and commercial businesses. Softeners are used in many applications, including boiler makeup water and process water.
                  <br>
                  The buildup caused by water hardness is capable of clogging, damaging pipes, and ruining equipment. Pipes and equipment last longer when used with soft water and keep maintenance costs down. Any facility dependent on boiler performance should use a water softener system to reduce the amount of scale forming minerals in the water. These minerals leave deposits in the boiler, which makes it harder to achieve the necessary temperatures for operation, making the process inefficient. Cooling towers also perform better with soft water.</span>

            Regeneration cycles inundate the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads with a highly concentrated brine solution, washing off the hardness minerals and draining them out of the system. The <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads are recharged and primed to again eliminate the hardness minerals. <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">Resin</a> beads are extremely durable and can effectively soften your water for twenty years or longer. Water softeners regenerate by one of two methods: co-current or counter-current regeneration (also referred to as downflow brining and upflow brining.
            <span class="about__heading content__heading" style="color: green;">Co-current regeneration cycle</span>
              <span class="about__p content__p var">
                In a co-current regeneration cycle, the brine solution enters the mineral tank in the same direction as the service flow. The brine solution flows down the depth of the bed of <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads and an ion exchange process occurs again, only this time in reverse. As the brine flows over the beads, the salts force the beads to release the magnesium and calcium ions in exchange for the sodium ion. As the brine passes through the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a>, an increasingly-concentrated surge of hardness minerals forms and flows through the entirety of the system. As the brine solution pushes more hardness minerals through the bed, continuous exchange and re-exchange of minerals and regeneration ions transpires. By the time the water has exited the tank, the solution’s strength is significantly reduced. In a co-current regeneration cycle, the highest charged beads will be on the ones at the top of the tank. Co-current regeneration uses more water and salt to complete the regeneration process than counter-current.

            <span class="about__heading content__heading" style="color: green;">Counter-current regeneration cycle</span>
              <span class="about__p content__p var">
                In a counter-current regeneration cycle, water enters the tank through the bottom of the mineral tank, where the water usually exits. The countercurrent cycle runs the brine up the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> bed, beginning at the bottom where the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> beads are usually the least depleted. This means there are fewer hardness minerals initiating re-exchange during the regeneration cycle. The brine is less depleted by the time it reaches the top of the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> bed, where the softener first makes contact with the hard water. A counter-current cycling water softener uses 75% less salt and 65% less water than co-current cycling. It also distributes the recharging sodium ions more equitably. In a countercurrent cycle, the most highly charged beads will be at the bottom of the tank, right before the water exits into the house. These are also known as high efficiency water softeners.

              <span class="about__heading content__heading" style="color: green;">When do I need to replace my water softener?</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var">
                  Water softeners typically have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly maintained. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit’s life. Protecting the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit. Iron will foul the <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">resin</a> and lower its ion exchange performance. <a href="./Data-sheets/purolite.pdf" class="featured-product__context--link" style="font-size: inherit; width: initial;display: initial;padding: initial;">Resin</a> cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals. Resin can last for 10-20 years if maintained well, however, heavily chlorinated water will exhaust the beads ion exchange capacity quickly. Heavy levels of sediment will also cause the screens and injectors within the control valve to fail prematurely. It is wise to place a sediment filter in front of your water softener, especially if you are on well water with lots of dirt and debris. If you live with extremely hard water (over 14 gpg), your system may not last as long as someone softening moderately hard water. 
                  <br>
                  The variance of factors make it difficult to determine a specific time frame for replacing a water softener. If the unit is over a decade old and you notice that it’s softening powers seem to be consistently declining, it may be time to invest in a new system. That being said, vigilant care and maintenance can extend a water softener’s lifespan. 
                </span>
              <span class="about__heading content__heading"  style="color: green;">Why is my water softener leaking?</span>
                <span class="about__p content__p var">
                  Water softeners leaks are primarily caused because of an issue at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with o-rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve’s seal is leaking, it is likely cracked and simply needs to be replaced.
                  <br>
                  Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn’t fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.  
                  <br>
                  To prevent electrical shock, you should never attempt to fix a leak while the softener is plugged in. Always unplug the softener from its electrical supply before attempting any repair or cleaning. You should also shut off the bypass valve on the water softener to prevent any further leaks and to isolate the unit from the rest of your home’s plumbing. If your softener does not have a bypass valve, turn off the water at the main line. If you cannot locate the cause of your leak call a plumber or the service that installed the unit.
